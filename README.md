SpO₂ Monitor – PCB Design Project

📌 Project Overview
Designed a custom PCB for a biomedical application to monitor SpO₂ (blood oxygen level) using a MAX30100/30102 sensor. The project was created using KiCad and demonstrates end-to-end PCB design flow.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- KiCad (Schematic + PCB Layout)
- 2-layer board design
- Sensor interfacing (MAX30100)
- Power and signal routing
- Gerber file generation
- 3D PCB visualization

📁 Project Files
- Schematic diagram (PDF)
- PCB layout screenshots
- 3D View of PCB
- Gerber files (for fabrication)

🔧 Features
- Support for MAX30100 SpO₂ sensor
- Microcontroller header (for future integration)
- Designed for compact size and simple routing

📎 Note
This project focuses on hardware design only. The PCB was not fabricated or assembled.
